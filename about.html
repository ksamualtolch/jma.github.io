During her education she interned aside the Creative Director of a popular menswear boutique in Chicago, building and creating visual content for their ecommerce site. She attributes this experience for her critical eye and attention to detail. Natalie grew a great passion for the restaurant and hospitality industry through her 4 years with Lettuce Entertain You and is eager to expand her knowledge further with the JMA team. Natalie enjoys spending most of her time in the kitchen—preferably with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and a kitchen table full of friends! She currently resides in Roscoe Village with her fiancé and their dog, Holiday.</p>
